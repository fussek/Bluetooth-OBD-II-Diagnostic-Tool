# Bluetooth-OBD-II-Diagnostic-Tool
The aim of this project was to create an Android application capable of connecting via a Bluetooth adaptor to the OBD2 car diagnostic socket (in vehicles supporting this protocol) and serve the communication with car's ECU. Application is capable of deciphering, formatting and visualising most of the signals generated by the ECU in real time, as well as providing support to all of the OBD operating modes. To test its functionality, multiple test runs were performed on 2016 Mitsubishi ASX, 2005 Fiat Panda and 2004 Seat Leon.
